# CourtListener — Backend Reference Card

Used by `/selfinvestigate` for U.S. federal (and some state) court filings, opinions, oral arguments, and PACER-backed docket entries. Run by the Free Law Project.

## Base URL

```
https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3
```

**Free API key required** — register at `courtlistener.com/sign-up/`. The token must be sourced from an environment variable (e.g., `COURTLISTENER_API_TOKEN`) and injected at request time. Never paste the literal token into a prompt, card, subagent instruction, or trace artifact. Include as header: `Authorization: Token <REDACTED>` (the runtime swaps in the env value). WebFetch doesn't support arbitrary headers directly, so note the token reference (never the literal) in the call or fall back to the public endpoint where available.

Rate limits: 5,000 req/hour with a token; lower without.

## Endpoints used

### 1. Universal search

```
GET /search/?q=<query>&type=<type>&court=<court>&filed_after=<YYYY-MM-DD>&filed_before=<YYYY-MM-DD>
```

`type` values:
- `o` — opinions (court decisions)
- `r` — RECAP documents (PACER docket entries; briefs, motions, exhibits)
- `d` — dockets (case-level metadata)
- `oa` — oral arguments (audio transcripts)
- `p` — judges / parties

`court` can be a specific court code (e.g., `scotus`, `ca9`, `dcd` for D.D.C.) or left blank for all.

### 2. Docket detail

```
GET /dockets/<id>/
```

Returns case metadata: case name, court, filing date, nature of suit, judge, party names, docket number, PACER link.

### 3. Docket entries (RECAP)

```
GET /docket-entries/?docket=<docket_id>
```

Returns every PACER docket entry for a case: filing date, entry number, description, and (where uploaded) the document URLs. RECAP is the public archive of PACER documents that someone has paid to retrieve.

### 4. Opinions

```
GET /opinions/?q=<query>&type=010combined&court=<court>
```

Full-text court opinions. Fields: author_id (judge), plain_text (the opinion text), date_filed, type (published, unpublished, per curiam).

### 5. Judges and parties

```
GET /people/?name=<name>
```

Returns judge profiles including appointment history, positions held, education, political affiliation (where known). Useful for actor-map enrichment.

## Response → source record mapping

| `snippet_used` | Specific docket entry text or opinion passage relevant to the investigation |

For an opinion:

| Source record field | CourtListener field |
|---|---|
| `canonical_id` | opinion `id` or `absolute_url` |
| `canonical_id_type` | `"courtlistener_opinion"` |

  prompt="Parse CourtListener docket search results. Return a JSON array. For each docket: id, case_name, case_name_full, court, docket_number, date_filed, date_terminated (if present), nature_of_suit, assigned_to_str, cause, absolute_url."
)
```

Retrieve opinion text:
```
WebFetch(
  url="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/<opinion_id>/",
  prompt="Parse the CourtListener opinion response. Return: id, case_name, court, date_filed, author_str, type, plain_text (the full opinion), and absolute_url. If plain_text is longer than 5000 chars, return the first 5000 chars and note plain_text_truncated: true."
)
```

Find docket entries for a case:
```
WebFetch(
  url="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/docket-entries/?docket=<docket_id>&ordering=date_filed",
  prompt="Parse docket entries. Return an array. For each entry: entry_number, date_filed, description, recap_documents array (each with filepath_ia, document_number, pacer_doc_id, description)."
)
```

## Actor and timeline extraction from filings

- **Parties** in a docket are actors by definition — plaintiffs, defendants, intervenors, amici. Each becomes an actor record with affiliation to the case.
- **Judge** is an actor; enrich with the `/people/` endpoint to get appointment history.
- **Filing dates** become timeline events: `complaint filed`, `motion to dismiss`, `summary judgment`, `verdict`, `appeal`, etc.
- **Counsel** (attorney names) appear in dockets — actors worth tracking for patterns of representation.
- **Related cases** often appear as cited precedent in opinions — graph edges between cases.

## Caveats

- **RECAP is not complete** — only documents someone paid to retrieve from PACER end up in RECAP. Absence from RECAP doesn't mean the document doesn't exist on PACER.
- **PACER documents cost money** — if a filing isn't in RECAP, retrieving from PACER costs $0.10/page. CourtListener doesn't cover that; you have to pay directly via PACER if you need the document.
- **State courts are spotty** — CourtListener's state coverage varies wildly. Some states are near-complete; others have almost nothing. Federal coverage is comprehensive.
- **Opinion publication lag** — unpublished opinions may take months to index. Recent decisions may not appear immediately.
- **Sealed filings** are invisible — the docket will show "SEALED DOCUMENT" as the description; the content isn't available. Note these in `missing_evidence.md` as deliberate gaps.
- **OCR quality varies** — older filings scanned from paper may have OCR errors in plain_text. For exact quotes, cross-reference the PDF if available.
- **Title case mismatches** — "United States v. Smith" and "U.S. v. Smith" may not match a naive search. Use variations.

## Security

Before any URL or header reaches `trace.md` or any other run artifact, the payload must be scrubbed so `Authorization: Token`, `api_key=`, `apikey=`, `token=`, and similar auth parameters show `<REDACTED>` as the value. Wave-search subagents run this redaction before emitting URLs or headers to their trace. Examples in this card already use `<REDACTED>` placeholders and must stay that way. If you see a literal API key or token in any run artifact, that is a bug — report and rotate.
